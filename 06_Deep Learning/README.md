# Deep Learning
The purpose of this snippet is to introduce deep learning with several cutting-edge models. Specifically, it consists of three parts: In the first part, implement various PyTorch deep learning layers using Numpy; in part two, experiment with different hyper-parameters on a image classification task and find the best hyper-parameters; lastly, investigate a state-of-the-art neural architecture from the PyTorch model zoo.
