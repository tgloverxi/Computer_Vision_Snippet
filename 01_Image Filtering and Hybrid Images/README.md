# Image Filtering and Hybrid Images
- Implemet different Image filters and apply them to sample images
    1. 1d gaussian 
    2. 2d gaussian
    3. bilateral
    4. median
-  Implement hybrid image: the sum of a low-pass filtered version of the one image and a high-pass filtered version of a second image
